      <p> My name is Camerion Brooks and this is my attempt at fixing and hosting a site, my first official site on GitHub. Here is a little about me. I was born and raised in central Virginia.
        I am married for going on eight years this October. I have three sons. I began coding serious in the Fall of 2019 and I haven't been able to pulll myself away from it since. Not hat I even want to.
        I am currently working my way through Skillcrush's amazing Break In To Tech program. THis course is strengthen the skill I already had on my own and I'm learning and master something new every day.
      </p>
      <p>My plan for the future in the air right now. I would love to join a major company and be a part of a team. I also want, or would enjoy the flexibility to be at home and available for my children.
        I pray that I am able to master enough language to fing that right fit and get out of the whell grind of work a job just to make ends meet. I want a career that can give me and my family a future.

          This is my first Skillcrush project.
          I utilized skills learned in their Break into Tech course.
          It is a great beginner project that I look forward to adding on to and building from.
